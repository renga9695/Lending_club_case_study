## Conclusions
- Lending club should reduce the high interest loans for 60 months tenure, they are prone to loan default. 
- Small business loans are defaulted more. Lending club should cautiously give the loans to them.
- Borrowers with mortgage home ownership are taking higher loans and defaulting the approved  loans. High Alert for Lending club when l loan amount asked is 12000 or more.
- Charging an Interest rate ranging between 21-25% can lead to a list of defaulters so we can minimize giving loans to the profile on which interest rate is calculated high.
- Grades can be one of the indicator for detecting defaulters. When grade is F or G and loan amount is between 15k-20k Those are more likely to be defaulters
- Lending Club should keep a check to the number of loan issues to borrowers who are from CA, FL and NY to avoid risks.
